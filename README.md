# Graffiti a city scape right in your browser! (MintBean Hackathon individual submission)


Open and a random image of city buildings will appear, which you can "graffiti" using a color change tool.

Frontend only, built from scratch using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. Taking advantage of Unsplash's public API and canvas.
